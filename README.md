# Timespan

Use Timespans in Ruby :)

Will calculate time diff between two dates, then allow you to get the time difference in some time unit as a number.

```ruby
	t = Timespan.new(:start => Date.today, :duration => 3.days)
	t.to_days # => 3
	t.to_weeks # => 0
	t.to_secs # => 259200
	t.to_hours = 10800

  t = Timespan.new("2 days") # from today
  t = Timespan.new(2.days) # from today
  t = Timespan.new(200) # 200 secs from today
  t = Timespan.new(duration: 2.days) # specific use of :duration option

  t = Timespan.new("3 hrs").from(2.days.from_now)

  t = Timespan.new(:from => 2.days.ago)

  t = Timespan.new(:end_date => 4.days.from_now)

	t = Timespan.new(:from => Date.today, :to => "6 weeks from now")	

	t = Timespan.new(:from => Date.today, :duration => "7 weeks 3 days")	
	t = Timespan.new(:from => 2.days.ago, :duration => "5 months and 2 weeks")	
```

See specs for more examples of usage

## Comparison

```ruby
timespan.between?(2.days.ago, 1.minute.from_now)
timespan.between?(1.days, 3.days)
timespan < 3.days
```

## Math

```ruby
3_days_more = timespan + 3.days
day_less = timespan -1 3.day
```

## Spanner

Internally Timespan uses Spanner to parse duration strings.

`Spanner.parse('23 hours 12 minutes')

## Duration (ruby-duration)

```ruby
Duration.new(100) => #<Duration: minutes=1, seconds=40, total=100>
Duration.new(:hours => 5, :minutes => 70) => #<Duration: hours=6, minutes=10, total=22200>

Duration.new(:weeks => 3, :days => 1).format("%w %~w and %d %~d") => "3 weeks and 1 day"
Duration.new(:weeks => 1, :days => 20).format("%w %~w and %d %~d") => "3 weeks and 6 days"
```

Duration locale file

```yaml
da:
  ruby_duration:
    second: sekond
    seconds: sekonder
    minute: minut
    minutes: minutter
    hour: time
    hours: timer
    day: dag
    days: dage
    week: uge
    weeks: uges
    month: m책ned
    months: m책neder
    year: 책r
    years: 책r
```

Duration datatype for Mongoid

```ruby
require 'duration/mongoid'

class MyModel
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :duration, type => Duration
end
```

## Timespan i18n

Timespan locale file

```yaml
da:
  timespan:
    from: fra
    to: til
    lasting: der varer ialt
```

## Timespan for Mongoid

Tested and works with Mongoid 2.4 and 3.0+

Custom Timespan datatype:

`Mongoid::Timespanned` adds the following class level macros:

* `timespan_methods target, *names`
* `timespan_delegates target, *names`
* `timespan_delegate name, target = :period`
* `timespan_setters target, *names`
* `timespan_setter target, name`

* `timespan_container_delegates container, timespan_field, *names`
* `timespan_container_delegate container, timespan_field, name`

Note that all the macros, take an `options` Hash as the last argument, where you can set `override: true` in order to override any existing methods. Otherwise an `ArgumentError` exception will be raised, to warn you of a method name conflict!

```ruby
require 'timespan/mongoid'

class Account
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Timespanned

  field :period, :type => Timespan

  timespan_methods :period

  embeds_one :time_period
  timespan_container_delegates :time_period, :dates, :start, :end  
end

class TimePeriod
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Timespanned

  field :dates, :type => ::Timespan, :between => true

  embedded_in :account

  timespan_methods :dates
end
```

Note: See `mongoid_timespan_spec.rb` for more examples of usage, and also see the `ClassMethods` module in `timespanned.rb` :)

Usage example:

```ruby
account = Account.create :period => {:duration => '2 days', :from => Date.today }

account.period.start_date
account.period.end_date
account.period.days
account.period.duration # => Duration

# using timespan setters defined by timespan_methods
account.period_start = tomorrow
account.period_end = 5.days.from_now

# using timespan delegates defined by timespan_methods
account.start_date == tomorrow
account.end_date == tomorrow

# using timespan_container_delegates on time_period
account.start_date = tomorrow
account.end_date = tomorrow + 5.days
```

## Factory method

Timespan now has the class level factory methods `#from` and `#untill`. 

### From

```ruby
account = Account.create :period => Timespan.from :tomorrow, 7.days

# today
Timespan.from :today, 7.days

# now
Timespan.from :asap, 7.days
Timespan.from :now, 7.days

# now
Timespan.from :today, 7.days

# starting one week from today
Timespan.from :next_week, 7.days

# starting first day next week
Timespan.from :next_week, 7.days, start: true

# starting first day next month
Timespan.from :next_month, 7.days, start: true
```

### Untill

Creates timespan from `Time.now` until the time specified.

```ruby
Timespan.untill :tomorrow
Timespan.untill :next_week
Timespan.untill :next_month, start: true
Timespan.untill 2.days.from_now
```

## Searching periods

```ruby
Account.where(:'period.from'.lt => 6.days.ago.to_i)
Account.where(:'period.from'.gt => 3.days.ago.to_i)

# in range
Account.where(:'period.from'.gt => 3.days.ago.to_i, :'period.to'.lt => Time.now.utc.to_i)
```

Make it easier by introducing a class helper:

```ruby
class Account
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :period, :type => Timespan

  def self.between from, to
    Account.where(:'period.from'.gt => from.to_i, :'period.to'.lte => to.to_i)
  end
end
```

`Account.between(6.days.ago, 1.day.ago)`

Alternatively auto-generate a `#between` helper for the field:

```ruby
class Account
  include Mongoid::Document
  field :period, :type => TimeSpan, :between => true
```

`Account.period_between(6.days.ago, 1.day.ago)`

See the `mongoid_search_spec.rb` for examples:

## Chronic duration

Is used to parse duration strings if Spanner can't be handle it

`ChronicDuration.parse('4 minutes and 30 seconds')

### Endure

Use the 'endure' gem based on the old "days_and_times".

See: [days_and_times](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/days_and_times)

Currently it also uses Duration, which conflicts with the 'ruby-duration' gem.

```
  1.day #=> A duration of 1 day
  7.days #=> A duration of 7 days
  1.week #=> A duration of 1 week
  1.week - 2.days #=> A duration of 5 days
  1.week.from(Now()) #=> The time of 1 week from this moment
  1.week.from(Today()) #=> The time of 1 week from the beginning of today
  3.minutes.ago.until(7.minutes.from(Now())) #=> duration 3 minutes ago to 7 minutes from now
  3.minutes.ago.until(7.minutes.from(Now())) - 2.minutes #=> duration 3 minutes ago to 5 minutes from now
  4.weeks.from(2.days.from(Now())).until(8.weeks.from(Yesterday())) #=> A duration, starting in 4 weeks and 2 days, and ending 8 weeks from yesterday
  1.week - 1.second #=> A duration of 6 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds
  4.weeks / 2 #=> A duration of 2 weeks
  4.weeks / 2.weeks #=> The integer 2
  8.weeks.each {|week| ...} #=> Runs code for each week contained in the duration (of 8 weeks)
  8.weeks.starting(Now()).each {|week| ...} #=> Runs code for each week in the duration, but each week is also anchored to a starting time, in sequence through the duration.
  1.week.each {|week| ...} #=> Automatically chooses week as its iterator
  7.days.each {|day| ...} #=> Automatically chooses day as its iterator
  1.week.each_day {|day| ...} #=> Forcing the week to iterate through days
  1.week.each(10.hours) {|ten_hour_segment| ...} #=> Using a custom iterator of 10 hours. There would be 17 of them, but notice that the last iteration will only be 8 hours.
``

## Configuration and overrides

Timespan by default uses `Time.now.utc` to set the current time, fx used when either `end_date` or `start_date` otherwise would be nil. This is used in order to work with Mongoid (see [issue #400](https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid/issues/400))

You can customize `now` to return fx `Time.now`, `Date.today` or whatever suits you.

```ruby
class Timespan
  def now
    Time.now # or Date.today
  end
end
```

By default the `TimeSpan` is stored using `:from` and `:to` for the start and end times. This can be customized as follows: 

```ruby
TimeSpan.start_field = :start
TimeSpan.end_field = :end
```

## Ranges

A Range can be converted into either a `Timespan` or a `DurationRange`

### DurationRange

```ruby
dr = (1..5).days # => DurationRange 1..5, :days
ts =(1..5).days(:timespan) # => Timespan start_date: 1.day.from_now, end_date: 5.days.from_now

dr.between?(4.days) # => true
```

You can also use Range#intersect from *sugar-high* gem to test intersection of time ranges ;)

## Client side helpers

This gem now includes som javascript assets to assist in performing date and timespan (duration) calculations on the client side also:

* `moment.js` (1.7.2)
* `date_ext.js` DP_DateExtensions
* `timespan.js`

### Example usage

```javascript
Date.timeleft("12/10/2012", "07/05/2013");
```

```javascript
Date.timeleft(Date.create("12/10/2012"), "07/05/2013");
```

Aliases for timeleft are: `duration` and `timespan`.

See the javascript source for the full API or check out http://momentjs.com/docs/ and http://depressedpress.com/javascript-extensions/dp_dateextensions/.

Note: timeleft was extracted from (http://www.proglogic.com/code/javascript/time/timeleft.php)

To use these assets with the Asset pipeline, simply add this to your `application.js` or similar manifest file :) (after jquery which is required!)

```javascript
//= require moment.js
//= require date_ext.js
//= require timespan.js
```
